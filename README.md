# Raspberry Pi Pico BMP388 Barometer Driver

BMP388 barometer driver for raspberry pi pico (pico c/c++ sdk projects).
this code libraray developed as part of my main project "FCP" (autonomous flight controller project),
it can be used for other projects thats need barometer sensor altitude and atmospheric pressure data,
based on the Bosch BMP388 chip (specifically Adafruit BMP388 sensor board).

Hardware:

[Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) â€¢
[Adafruit BMP388](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bmp388-bmp390-bmp3xx)

This driver libraray uses Bosch Sensortec library (2020-07-20) under BSD-3-Clause license.
